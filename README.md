# NATuG3

### A program designed to streamline the nucleic acid nanotube design process.

Creating nanoscale tubular structures is an inherently tricky task, made possible by taking advantage of DNA’s unique
structure. The strategic placement of Watson-Crick DNA base pairings in synthetic DNA allows for the creation of
extremely precise nanotubes, with applications ranging from improved drug delivery to tissue wound repair. The design
process requires both close attention to DNA’s complex geometry, precise alignment of strands, and careful base
selection computations.

## Quickstart Instructions

It is advised that you [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for installing
library requirements (step 4). However, the easiest way to get the program running is as follows:

1) install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3) open terminal and enter
4) pip install -r requirements.txt
5) python launcher.py
