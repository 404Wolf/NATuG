# NATuG3

### A program designed to streamline the nucleic acid nanotube design process.

Creating nanoscale tubular structures is an inherently tricky task, made possible by taking advantage of DNA’s unique structure. The strategic placement of Watson-Crick DNA base pairings in synthetic DNA allows for the creation of extremely precise nanotubes, with applications ranging from improved drug delivery to tissue wound repair. The design process requires both close attention to DNA’s complex geometry, precise alignment of strands, and careful base selection computations.

## Setup
It is advised that you [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for installing library requirements (step 4). However, the easiest way to get the program running is as follows:
1) install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3) open terminal and enter
4) pip install -r requirements.txt
5) python launcher.py
